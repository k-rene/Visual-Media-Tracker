# Kae-Rene's Personal Project: Revenge of the Calories
### A Food Consumption Tracker for Disaster Children

**Revenge of the Calories** is a food consumption tracker. It's primary purpose is to **aid individuals in 
discovering allergies** by generating a correlation between reaction logs with common ingredients that have been consumed.
It could also be used to **track calories** being consumed by an individual, as well as one's **nutritional consumptions**.
Additionally, I hope to be able to detect a lack of any nutrients based on consumption history.   

This application can be used by anyone but is specifically targeted towards those who are going through a 
change in diets or are struggling with identifying allergens and cannot afford official testing. 
I myself fall into both of these categories. Having just recently gone vegetarian, my family is rightfully concerned 
that I am not consuming all the nutrients that 
I, as a human being, require. Additionally, since moving here, I have had several reactions towards *some foods.* 
However, I have yet to identify a cause. As such, I hope to build this application to keep myself, and others like me,
safe and healthy.
