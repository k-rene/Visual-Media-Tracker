# Kae-Rene's Personal Project: Revenge of the Nibbles
## A Food Consumption Tracker for Disaster Children

**Revenge of the Nibbles** is a food consumption tracker. It's primary purpose is to **aid individuals in 
discovering allergies and intolerances** by generating a correlation between reaction logs with common 
ingredients that have been consumed.

This application can be used by anyone but is specifically targeted towards those who are struggling with 
identifying allergens and cannot afford official testing. Since moving to Canada, I have had several reactions 
towards *some foods.* However, I have yet to identify a cause. As such, I hope to build this application to keep myself,
and others like me, safe and healthy.
