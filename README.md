# Kae-Rene's Personal Project: First World Problems
## A Visual Media Tracker for Disaster Children

**First World Problems** is a movie and TV show tracker. It's primary purpose is to **allow individuals with 
subscriptions to multiple streaming platforms to store all their current viewings in one place.** This reduces
the need for the users to remember which streaming platform they were watching a particular show on. It also allows for 
users to easily identify shows that they have yet to complete if they went on a viewing break.

This application can be used by anyone but is specifically *targeted at those who are inconsistent with their viewing 
habits, as well as their media sources*. As someone who's interest in shows fluctuates like Vancouver's weather, but 
hates not finishing a series I've started watching, this application is something I am in much need of.
